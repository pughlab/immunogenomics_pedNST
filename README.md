# Immunogenomics of pediatric nervous system tumours

This repo contains custom R codes used for figures in the manuscript "Transcriptional immunogenomic analysis reveals distinct immunological clusters in pediatric nervous system tumours".

# How to run

This repo is linked to the CodeOcean capsule link xxxxxxxx. 

# Data availability

CBTN raw RNA and WGS data, variant and fusion calls are available upon request at kidsfirstdrc.org. TCGA and TARGET data can be accessed upon request through GDC (https://gdc.cancer.gov/). 

Gene expression matrices, clinical metadata, T- and B- clonotype files, HLA types, predicted neopeptides, variant and fusion datasets and deconvolution outputs are available upon free registration at https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/u/pughlab/immpedcan. 

All processed data can be found in `/data/` or as supplemental tables for the manuscript. Main figures are reproducible via CodeOcean capsule: xxxxx
