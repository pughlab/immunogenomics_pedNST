description: 'To inform immunotherapy treatments in children, we performed an immunogenomic
  analysis of RNA-seq data from 925 treatment-naïve pediatric nervous system tumours
  (pedNST) spanning 12 cancer types from 3 public data sets. In contrast to 17% of
  adult cancers, 72% of pedNSTs harboured immunologically cold microenvironments.
  Within pedNST, we uncovered four broad immune clusters: Pediatric Inflamed (10%),
  Myeloid Predominant (30%), Immune Neutral (43%) and Immune Excluded (17%). We validated
  these clusters using immunohistochemistry, methylation immune inference, and segmentation
  analysis of tissue images. We report shared biology of these immune clusters within
  and across cancer types, and characterization of specific immune cell composites
  including T- and B-cell repertoire sequences. We found no associations between immune
  infiltration levels and tumour mutational burden, although molecular cancer subtypes
  were enriched within specific immune clusters. Given the heterogeneity within and
  across pedNST, our findings suggest personalized immunogenomic profiles are needed
  to guide selection of immunotherapeutic strategies.'
